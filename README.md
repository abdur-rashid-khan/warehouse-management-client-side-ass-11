I am using many components in this project, I keep them inside the src folder

Different requirements install different frameworks but do not use all frameworks.


The frameworks I'm using are:
 - `react ` .  
 - `firebase` . 
 - `react-firebase-hooks`
 - `sweetalert2`
 - ` heroicons`
 - ` axios`
 - ` tailwindcss`
